/**
 * A local search algorithm that traverses a {@link Graph} to find a

 *
 * A {@code LocalSearch} is used to solve a computationally hard optimization
 * problem. It starts from one or more randomly generated nodes and navigates the
 * {@link Graph} until a node deemed optimal is found or a time bound is elapsed.
 * A {@link Heuristic} is used to evaluate nodes and decide how to navigate the
 * {@link Graph} accordingly.<p>
 *
 * Unlike a {@link Visit}, a {@code LocalSearch} does not return a path, but
 * only one node is returned.<p>
 *
 * Optionally, users can provide a {@link Consumer} that will be called on each
 * explored node when it is visited.<p>
 *
 * The {@link LocalSearches} class provides factory methods for various local search
 * algorithms.
